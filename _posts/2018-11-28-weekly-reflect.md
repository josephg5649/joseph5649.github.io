This week in CS, we took a midterm test to have Mr.Allata see where we are at in this class.  An example of one of the questions is question 13

Choose the contract of the function that would solve the following problem.

Design a function that takes in the color of a circle and produces a small dot of the given radius.
(a) ;dot: String -> Image
(b) ;dot: Number -> String
(c) ;dot: Number -> Image
(d) (dot "green")
The answer to the question is (a). This question was an apprentice in difficulty, meaning weâ€™ve seen this type of question before.on 52% of people got this correct. This question is good because it test our skill to see if we can remember what the correct way to write that function is.
