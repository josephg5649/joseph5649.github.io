Part One
This week in my class “Intro to Computer Science” class we started to learn the basics of the coding langauge “Racket”. To do this we used the WeScheme OpenEditor (https://www.wescheme.org/openEditor).

In the editor we learned how to make basic shapes like circles, squares, rectangles and triangles. After that we worked with a partner to make a set of shapes.

A connection I made this week is that earlier in the week and late last week we learned how to make basic shapes in the WeScheme OpenEditor. We had to apply that knowledge yesterday (10/11/2018) when we worked with a partner to create different shapes.

Part Two
I think I did a good job learning in class this week. I pushed myself to try and figure out more so I could have an advantage when doing tasks and so I could teach my classmates. Our first task in the WeScheme OpenEditor this week was to create a flag. First we had to draw the flag on paper, then we got construction paper, glue sticks and scissors to cut out and paste the flag together. Finally, we had to make the flag in the OpenEditor.

I found this task interesting, especially because we had the freedom to pick almost any flag we wanted to. I chose to make the Holy Roman Empire Flag, a country that existed between 800 and 1806. I had a few challenges creating this flag, as I had to cut out a coat of arms to paste, but once I got that done I did not have any more challenges on paper.
