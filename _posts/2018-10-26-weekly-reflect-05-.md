# Part 1: The first bentchmark. 
There has been alot we have learned from the beginning of school to now. We started off small coding the computer to solve a a simple math equation, this simple lession taught us that order matters in coding and if something was in the wrong spot the code must be re-done. We had then moved on to learning how to code shapes and what the computer reads/does when given certan comands numbers are required to get the shape 1 desires. After a week dedicated to that we then proceeded to code a flag we learned then how to give a code of information a nick name by defining th shape. We also learned how to overlay shapes using "put-image". We then finaly come to try to code a game similar to the one we played in the begining by using images to define the danger, player, and target.
# Part 2 connections
These skills can help us further understand why and how computer read codes the way it does. The way i connect coding to the real world is that a computer runs like a goverment give it the wrong information it could go wrong. Not only that but for a government to run order is required just like a computer. If your series of coding is incorrect or not in the right order chos would happen nothing would run.
# Part 3 Challengese and oppertunities
To be quite frank this class has many challenges but once overcome it leads to new oppertunities. For example when i was doing the flag project i was having a lot of trouble trying to overlay images and it got fustated. It was until i relized that my order of typing the code in wrong that order has a huge impact on coding and if it wasn't for that i wouldn't be able to the video game.
